# 🏥 Insurance Cost Prediction

This project builds a regression model to predict medical insurance costs based on user features like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `insurance_prediction.ipynb`: Full Colab notebook including:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
  - Model Evaluation

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset contains information about individuals and their insurance charges.

- Columns:
  - `age`: Age of the individual
  - `sex`: Gender
  - `bmi`: Body Mass Index
  - `children`: Number of children
  - `smoker`: Whether the individual smokes
  - `region`: Region in the US
  - `charges`: Medical insurance cost (target)

## 🧠 Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- pandas, NumPy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 Output

A trained machine learning model capable of predicting insurance charges with good accuracy.
